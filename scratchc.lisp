;;Build-table is a macro that automatically wraps a &body in calls to formatting-row

;;eight cells per row.

;;The call to the presenter is itself embedded within another formatting table, which
;;is drawn by the draw-year function.

;;The function draw-day-rectangle draws a small rectangle filled with colour to represent
;;the each specific day. I does this using draw-rectangle*
